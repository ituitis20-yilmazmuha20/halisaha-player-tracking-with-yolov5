# Project Description
This project aims to develop a computer vision system capable of tracking players during football matches. 
While the primary function of this system is to effectively track these entities, its output can be integrated into various applications such
 as providing detailed post-match analysis, enhancing live game watching experiences, or offering insights for coaching strategies.

 
# Setup and Installation
To get this project up and running, you'll need to set up the YOLOv5, part of the Ultralytics repository. Follow these steps for a smooth setup:

1. Clone the YOLOv5 Repository:
Clone the YOLOv5 repository from Ultralytics by running:  
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git  
Navigate into the cloned directory:  
cd yolov5

3. Integrate Project Files:

Drag and drop your project files into the yolov5 directory. This will overwrite some of the files in the yolov5 directory, but that's okay.
If prompted with a warning about file replacement, choose 'Replace' to overwrite the old files with your new ones.

3. Install Dependencies:
Install the required dependencies by running:  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
This step installs all the necessary packages listed in the requirements.txt file, which includes both YOLOv5's dependencies and any additional libraries required.

4. Run the Analysis:
Launch the analysis by opening and running analysis_code.ipynb.  
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for your specific analysis tasks.
